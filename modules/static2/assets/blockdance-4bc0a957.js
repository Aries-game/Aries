  <p>12. If a provision of this Agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, that

  <p>14. ADVANTAGE PLAY</p>
  <p>Should the Casino become aware of any user who has accepted the bonus or a promotion with sole purpose of creating
    a positive expected value on bonus return by using known practices aimed at securing a cash out of said bonus or at
    any way try to take advantage of bonuses received by __BC_HOST__, then __BC_HOST__ will enforce immediate
    confiscation of
    winnings and closure of the account with the right to withhold any further withdrawals. An example of advantage play
    would be delaying any game round in any game, including free spins features and bonus features, to a later time when
    you have no more wagering requirement and/or performing new deposit(s) while having free spins features or bonus
    features still available in a game. In the interests of fair gaming, equal, zero or low margin bets or hedge
    betting, shall all be considered irregular gaming for bonus play- through requirement purposes. Should the Casino
    deem that irregular game play has occurred, the Casino reserves the right to withhold any withdrawals and/or
    confiscate all winnings.</p>

    funds are used purely to progress through the bonus stages (e.g. collecting 9 out of 10 coins to reach that bonus
    feature) and then final stages (e.g. playing to collect the final coin to reach 10 out of 10 coins to reach the
    bonus feature) completed with cash bets when bonus funds have been forfeited, lost or wagering met and converted to
    cash. All the winnings gained during that play may be considered void.</p>
  <p>Multiple accounts are not permitted. Creating more than one accounts with __BC_HOST__ in order to claim any
    bonuses is
    deemed as bonus abuse and may result in confiscated funds.</p>
  <p>The English version of these Bonus Terms is general and final. Translations into other languages may be made as a
    service and are made in good faith. However, in the event of differences between the English version and a
    translation, the English version has priority over any translation.</p>
  <p>__BC_HOST__ management has the right to update these rules at any time. </p>
