  <h2>Free Lottery Bonus Guidelines</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Claim Frequency: The Free Lottery bonuses we offer can be claimed once a day. Any unredeemed lottery bonuses
      within 24 hours of issuance will be forfeited for that day, but you can continue to claim the lottery bonuses for
      the following days if there are any lottery bonuses left.</li>
    <li>Wagering Requirement: To make a withdrawal after winning with a free lottery ticket, a 60x wagering requirement
      must be fulfilled. The maximum withdrawal amount is limited to the lottery prize amount, any excess amount is
      non-withdrawable.</li>
    <li>KYC Verification: If one of the free lottery tickets you claimed wins, we have the right to request that you
      complete the KYC (Know Your Customer) verification before receiving the winning amount. For KYC purposes, the
      following documents will be necessary for verification: a government-approved identity card (ID card, passport, or
      driver's license) with a photograph, and we may also request proof of residency, such as a utility bill (issued
      within the past 90 days). This verification process ensures the security and legitimacy of prize claims.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>General bonus terms</h2>
  <p>
    1. KYC Requirements: For any no deposit bonus withdrawals (including but not limited to Newbie Task Bonus, Newbie
    Lucky Spin Bonus), we reserve the right to request a KYC. Regarding the KYC (Know Your Customer), the following
    documents will be needed for verification: One government-approved identity card (ID card, passport, and driver's
    license) with a picture, and we may also request your proof of residency such as a utility bill (issued within the
    past 90 days). If your deposit was via a credit card, we will require a photo of the credit card (front and back)
    showing all 4 corners.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Bonus Money Usage: When playing with Bonus money, the generated wager is only used to calculate Rollover progress
    and is not counted towards any requirements that require Real money, such as VIP upgrades, Commissions, recharges,
    etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Non-Contributing Games: The following games do not contribute towards the completion of the wagering requirement
    of a bonus.
  </p>
  <div class="blocked-game-list"></div>
  <p>
    4. Jackpot Qualification: Bonus rounds and free spins do not qualify for the jackpot bonuses pursuant to casino
    software provider rules. Only real money rounds qualify for the jackpot bonuses.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Maximum Bet: Until the 40 times (60 times for No Deposit Bonus) rollover requirements have been met, the maximum
    bet that is allowed to be placed is $5 or equivalent assets.
  </p>
  <p>
    6. Minimum Balance Cancellation: Since $0.2 falls below the game's minimum bet, the system will cancel any Bonus
    balance less than $0.2 and also remove the associated wagering requirements for that reward.
  </p>
  <p>
    7. Minimal Risk Bets: Minimal risk bets on any games (i.e., betting in proportions on different outcomes in the same
    hand to create "action" with minimal risk) do not qualify for completing the wagering requirement. Examples of
    minimal risk bets include betting on red and black simultaneously in Roulette and betting player and banker
    simultaneously in Baccarat.
  </p>
  <p>
    8. Internal Audit: All withdrawals will be subject to an internal audit before being processed. __BC_HOST__ reserves
    all rights to void Bonuses or any winnings for failed audits. The Player hereby consents in advance to the same. If,
    upon such a review, it appears that a Player(s) is participating in actions, taking advantage of any software or
    system bug or failure, __BC_HOST__ reserves the right to revoke the entitlement of such a Player to receive or
    benefit from the promotion (and/or withhold the payout of the proceeds of such abuse to the Player(s) in question).
    Only fully settled bets (i.e., bets that result in a win or loss) will be counted towards wagering.
  </p>
  <p>
    9. Prohibited Bonus Progression: The use of bonus funds purely to progress through the bonus stages is prohibited.
    For example, when a bonus or cash funds are used purely to progress through the bonus stages (e.g., collecting 9 out
    of 10 coins to reach that bonus feature) and then final stages (e.g., playing to collect the final coin to reach 10
    out of 10 coins to reach the bonus feature) completed with cash bets when bonus funds have been forfeited, lost, or
    wagering met and converted to cash. All the winnings gained during that play may be considered void.
  </p>
  <p>
    10. Multiple Accounts: Multiple accounts are not permitted. Creating more than one account with __BC_HOST__ to claim
    any bonuses is deemed as bonus abuse and may result in confiscated funds.
  </p>
  <p>
    11. Language Priority: The English version of these Bonus Terms is general and final. Translations into other
    languages may be made as a service and are made in good faith. However, in the event of differences between the
    English version and a translation, the English version has priority over any translation.
  </p>
  <p>12. Rule Updates: __BC_HOST__ management has the right to update these rules at any time.</p>
