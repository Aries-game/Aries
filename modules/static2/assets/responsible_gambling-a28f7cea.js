  <h2>Always Keep In Mind:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Gambling should be fun and entertaining, not a means to make money.</li>
    <li>Gambling is not a solution for financial difficulties.</li>
    <li>
      DSet a gambling budget and adhere to it. Monitor your spending and only
      gamble with the predetermined amount.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not chase losses or gamble with money designated for other budget
      areas.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensure that gambling only occurs during free time allocated for hobbies
      and does not interfere with daily activities. Keep track of the time spent
      gambling.

  <h2>Protect Yourself And Gamble Responsibly</h2>
  <p>
    If you cannot gamble responsibly, the safest option is to refrain from
    gambling altogether. This will prevent potential risks to yourself and your

    gambling. At __BC_HOST__, support is always available, and we welcome

  <p>
    All casinos and games have an inherent RTP (Return to Player) and a house
    edge which favors the casino over the long term. Remember, the money you
    gamble should be disposable income, as gambling is about enjoyment and fun.
    These games of chance could result in wins or losses.
